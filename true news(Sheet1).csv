A dream derailed,": In the puzzle to solve Bengaluru’s traffic nightmare, the long-delayed Bengaluru Suburban Railway Project (BSRP) was billed as the third pillar of public transport after Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and Namma Metro. The project was sanctioned in October 2020 after decades of deliberation and was designed to carry nearly 20 lakh commuters every day across Bengaluru and its outskirts. It envisaged modern nine-coach air-conditioned trains running at high frequencies of five to 12 minutes along four corridors stretching 148 kilometres and covering 58 stations. The sanctioned cost of ?15,767 crore was seen as an investment in not only mobility, but also economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Corridor One, running between Majestic and Kempegowda International Airport, was given priority and was originally scheduled to be completed by October 2023, well ahead of the full project deadline of October 2026. 3 years on, little progress When Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone in June 2022, he assured citizens that the 148-km network would be delivered within 40 months, ending a 40-year wait.

Jammu and Kashmir High Court grants U.T. government 20 days to submit final stand on Gulmarg lease issue,"The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Thursday (August 29, 2025) granted 20 days to the Union Territory government to submit its final stand on the Gulmarg lease issue, in the wake of the Raj Bhawan and the Chief Minister’s office taking two separate positions. Dozens of hoteliers are unable to extend their lease period after the Lt.-Governor’s administration replaced the rules for lease with a new one in 2022. The Division Bench, comprising J&K Chief Justice Arun Palli and justice Rajnesh Oswal, decided to hear the Gulmarg lease issue again on September 17, while passing the direction to the U.T. government to submit its final stand.

Rajasthan High Court cancels 2021 Sub-Inspector exam over paper leak,"The Rajasthan High Court on Thursday cancelled the police Sub-Inspector recruitment examination of 2021 after finding large-scale irregularities, including paper leak and involvement of members of the State Public Service Commission (RPSC) in the scam. The court declared null and void the exam as well as the selection of Sub-Inspectors. Justice Sameer Jain at the High Court’s Jaipur Bench, who had earlier reserved the judgment after a prolonged hearing on a writ petition filed by 25 individuals, pronounced the verdict in the open court, while observing that the examination process was vitiated by “illegality and fraud on the system”. The court criticised the State government for its inaction, pointing out that despite glaring evidence, no decisive steps were taken. The BJP government had opposed the writ petition, saying it would be premature to cancel the exam before the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan police completes its probe. A Cabinet Sub-Committee, which examined various aspects of the recruitment exam, had also recommended against cancellation. It said only 6.3% of examinees were found to be tainted in the SOG probe, while 93.7% appeared to be clean. The recommendation was approved by Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.

"CPI(M), UDF lock horns over protests against Shafi Parambil in Kozhikode","The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] are coming face to face in Kozhikode district over attempts by Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists to corner Vadakara MP Shafi Parambil, alleging that he was “protecting” Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. Though district DYFI leaders claimed that the organisation had not officially decided to disrupt events attended by Mr. Parambil, the MP faced the ire of local activists twice in the past week. The tipping point came on August 27, when his vehicle was waylaid by DYFI cadre as he was leaving an Onam event for differently abled children. Heated arguments followed, with Mr. Parambil stepping out of his car and alleging that the activists hurled abuse at him. However, local DYFI leaders later contended that the provocation originated from one of Mr. Parambil’s aides inside the vehicle. Subsequently, youth organisations aligned with the UDF, along with leaders of its ally, the Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMP), including Vadakara MLA K.K. Rema, took to the streets in Vadakara and Perambra. Amid the melee, allegations surfaced that V.P.

Another low pressure off Bay of Bengal likely to bring in more rain,"More rainfall is in store over the coming days, with another weather system - a low-pressure area - expected to form in the Bay of Bengal, near north Odisha, in the first week of September. This system is likely to bring rain to north Telangana and the twin cities, according to meteorologists at the Telangana Development Planning Society (TDPS) on Thursday. In fact, August has turned out to be the wettest month in the last five years, with an 80% excess in rainfall - about 36 cm recorded so far this month. The normal rainfall for August in Telangana is typically around 21.6 cm. “We’ve usually seen heavy rainfall in July, and moderate to normal rainfall in August over the past few years. But this year, the pattern has reversed. While July saw just a 5% excess, August has brought heavy to extremely heavy rainfall,” explained senior weather consultant Y.V. Rama Rao in an exclusive interaction. The heavy rains are attributed to a combination of an ‘active’ southwest monsoon and a depression in the Bay of Bengal. The current system is moving towards Chhattisgarh, which could reduce the extent of rainfall, at least, in the capital from tomorrow, he added. 25% excess rainfall so far Districts in north Telangana - Medak, Kamareddy, Nizamabad, Karimnagar and others - have been experiencing heavy rainfall over the past few days.

She told the media here on Thursday (August 28, 2025) that “a serious sexual harasser and offender” was being “defended and supported” by the Leader of the Opposition from the Congress. “You suspended an MLA obviously because you found that he had indeed done something wrong.

This is utter hypocrisy. Not only that, it is an insult to the women of Kerala. When you are defending a serious sexual offender, the six-month suspension is meaningless.
